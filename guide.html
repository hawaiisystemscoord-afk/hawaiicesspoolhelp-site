  <h1>Guide</h1>
  <p>A clear homeowner guide to cesspool conversion on Hawaiʻi Island.</p>
 </div>
</header>

  <div class="guide-inner">
    <section class="guide-section guide-intro">
      <h2>How the cesspool conversion process works on Hawaiʻi Island</h2>
      <p>Hawaiʻi has roughly 83,000 cesspools that must be upgraded or connected to sewer by the year 2050. That mandate applies to every cesspool property, from small in town lots to larger rural parcels. The rules are detailed, the forms are technical, and most owners only do this once in a lifetime.</p>
      <p>The goal of this guide is to turn that large, slow project into a simple set of steps. Instead of trying to track engineers, installers, and permits on your own, you see how the process works when one coordinator keeps everything moving. Every example on this page assumes you work through Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help as your funnel, not by calling around on your own.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="guide-section">
      <h3>Why this guide matters</h3>
      <p>Many homeowners put off important work when 3 things show up together. Cost, confusion, and the feeling that once you start there is no clear way through. On Hawaiʻi Island the soil, slope, shoreline, and water table change from property to property, which adds even more uncertainty.</p>
      <p>Act 125 sets a firm deadline for cesspool conversion, but it does not explain how to move from that deadline to a finished and approved system in your yard. Engineers focus on design, installers focus on construction, and agencies focus on review. None of them are responsible for explaining the entire journey in plain language.</p>
      <p>This guide fills that gap. It lays out the actual path from first intake to final approval and shows where a coordinator sits in the middle. When you understand the steps and know that one team is watching the whole project instead of just a part of it, it becomes much easier to start.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="guide-section">
      <h3>Why cesspools are being phased out</h3>
      <p>Cesspools were once a common way to deal with wastewater because they were simple and cheap to build. Wastewater from the house flows into a pit in the ground and slowly soaks into the surrounding soil. Over time, that same simple system turned into a long term problem for drinking water, streams, and nearshore reefs.</p>
      <p>Untreated wastewater can carry nutrients, bacteria, chemicals from everyday life, and household products. When that water seeps into the ground in large volumes, it can reach wells, springs, and the ocean. On an island this impact does not stay hidden for long. It shows up as algae on the reef, closed beaches after heavy rain, and long term pressure on drinking water sources.</p>
      <p>The state response is the statewide cesspool conversion mandate. By 2050 every cesspool must either be upgraded to a qualified system or connected to sewer where that is available. That is a large and complex task at the state level, but at the property level the requirements are straightforward. Each parcel needs a design that meets the rules, a permit, and a properly installed system that is signed off by a licensed engineer.</p>
      <p>Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help exists to help homeowners move through that property level journey. We do not set the rules or issue approvals. We organize the work so that your engineer, installer, and permit reviewers can each do their part without leaving you to manage the entire chain on your own.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="guide-section">
      <h3>The full process in 5 steps</h3>
      <p>Almost every cesspool conversion on Hawaiʻi Island follows the same basic 5 steps. The details change from property to property, but the sequence does not. Once you understand this pattern, the project feels less like a mystery and more like a checklist that can be completed.</p>

          <div class="num">1</div>
          <div>
            <h4>Initial assessment</h4>
            <p>A licensed engineer visits the property and looks at slope, soil, space, and nearby water to see what is allowed and where a new system can realistically go.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="step">

          <div>
            <h4>Engineering and design</h4>
            <p>The engineer creates a design that fits the site and meets Department of Health rules, including setbacks, elevations, and treatment type.</p>

          <div>
            <h4>Permitting</h4>
            <p>The design is submitted for review so the new system can be approved before any excavation or installation begins.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <div class="num">4</div>
          <div>
            <h4>Installation</h4>
            <p>An installer builds the system, sets the tank and components, connects everything, and restores the yard as agreed in the scope of work.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <div class="num">5</div>
          <div>
            <h4>Final approval</h4>
            <p>The engineer confirms the system matches the plan and files final documents for official approval and your property records.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Some properties require extra checks, such as soil tests or elevation adjustments. Those pieces still fit inside the same 5 step structure. Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help keeps that structure in view, even when small changes are needed, so the project keeps moving instead of stalling between steps.</p>

      <h3>What each step looks like</h3>
      <div class="step-detail-grid">
        <article class="step-card">
          <h3>Step 1 Initial assessment</h3>
          <p><strong>What happens</strong></p>
          <p>A licensed engineer visits your property and looks at slope, soil, available space, buildings, driveways, and the location of water sources such as wells, streams, or the shoreline. This visit is where many key decisions are made, even if they do not show up on paper yet. The engineer is deciding what type of system can pass review and where it can safely sit.</p>
          <p>A solid assessment prevents problems later. A rushed assessment can lead to designs that do not fit the site, tanks placed in difficult locations, or plans that have to be revised during permitting. That is when projects become slow and expensive.</p>
          <p><strong>Your role</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide basic property information such as tax map key, address, and how many bedrooms are in use.</li>
            <li>Show roughly where the old cesspool sits if you know or have any past drawings.</li>
            <li>Mention any future plans, such as adding a bedroom or a small rental, so the engineer can design with that in mind.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>How Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help supports you</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>We collect your details through a simple intake so the engineer arrives with parcel maps and context instead of starting from zero.</li>
            <li>We connect you with an engineer who works in your area and is familiar with local soil, rainfall, and agency expectations.</li>
            <li>We help schedule the visit and make sure expectations are clear about what will be covered, so you are not left guessing after the engineer leaves.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>By the end of Step 1 you should know what general type of system your property is likely to receive and where it might go. You do not need every detail yet, but you should feel that someone is looking at the entire property, not just one corner of the yard.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="step-card">
          <h3>Step 2 Engineering and design</h3>
          <p><strong>What happens</strong></p>
          <p>The engineer takes the site information and creates a design that fits your property and meets health rules. This includes tank size and location, disposal area, elevations, treatment level, pump selection if needed, and all required setbacks. Some sites also need soil or elevation checks, which may involve extra field time or coordination with a surveyor.</p>
          <p>This design step sets the cost and difficulty of the project. A smart layout can shorten pipe runs, protect useful yard space, and avoid avoidable retaining walls or unnecessary pumping. A poor layout can do the opposite.</p>
          <p><strong>Your role</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Answer practical questions about how you use the property, such as guest use, short term rentals, or shared family living.</li>
            <li>Share your preferences when there is more than one acceptable layout, such as which areas you want to preserve for parking, gardens, or play areas.</li>
            <li>Review the general concept so you understand where work will happen and where access is needed.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>How Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help supports you</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>We keep an eye on progress so your design does not sit in a pile waiting for attention while months go by.</li>
            <li>We help the engineer gather maps, parcel data, and any previous plans, so you are not repeatedly asked for the same information.</li>
            <li>We translate design language into plain terms so you know what you are getting, not just what is drawn on the page.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>By the end of Step 2 you have a clear plan on paper. You know where the tank and disposal areas will go, what parts of the yard will be disturbed, and what kind of system will serve the property for the long term.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="step-card">
          <h3>Step 3 Permitting</h3>
          <p><strong>What happens</strong></p>
          <p>The engineer submits the design to the Department of Health for review. Staff check that the plan follows current rules for system type, setbacks, and capacity. Sometimes they ask for small clarifications, updated forms, or minor revisions. Until the design is approved, the installer should not start work.</p>
          <p>This step is where many projects stall when no one is watching the file. Reviewers may be busy, engineers may be focused on other work, and homeowners may not know whether the delay is normal or a sign that something is missing.</p>
          <p><strong>Your role</strong></p>
          <p>Most of the time your only tasks at this stage are to sign the application or owner forms and to be available if a question comes up that only you can answer, such as how many separate dwellings use the system.</p>
          <p><strong>How Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help supports you</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>We monitor permit status and check in so your project does not get buried under newer submissions.</li>
            <li>We help the engineer respond quickly when the reviewer has questions, so small issues do not stretch into long delays.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>By the end of Step 3 you have an approved design. That approval is the green light for installation and a key document for your records.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="step-card">
          <h3>Step 4 Installation</h3>
          <p><strong>What happens</strong></p>
          <p>The installer brings equipment to the site, excavates, sets the tank and components, runs pipe and electrical lines, backfills, and restores the surface as agreed. Some yard disruption is normal for a short period. There can be heavy equipment, open trenches, and stockpiled material. Good planning limits the disruption and restores order quickly once work is complete.</p>
          <p>This is the step most homeowners picture when they think about cesspool conversion. In reality it is only one part of the journey, but it is the part you feel most in your daily life while it is happening.</p>
          <p><strong>Your role</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clear access areas and move vehicles or items that block the planned work area or equipment path.</li>
            <li>Confirm how the yard will look at the end, including any gravel, concrete, or landscaping that will be replaced or left for later.</li>
            <li>Keep pets and children away from active work areas for their safety.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>How Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help supports you</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>We help you connect with trusted local installers when possible, instead of leaving you to guess based only on price or advertising.</li>
            <li>We coordinate timing with the engineer so inspections and checks happen smoothly and the installer is not left waiting for signoff.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>By the end of Step 4 the physical work on your property is mostly done. You have a working system in the ground and the site is returning to normal daily use.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="step-card">
          <h3>Step 5 Final approval</h3>
          <p><strong>What happens</strong></p>
          <p>The engineer visits or confirms as needed that the system matches the approved design. They then submit final paperwork to the Department of Health. Once that paperwork is accepted, your new system is officially approved and the old cesspool is no longer part of your active wastewater system.</p>
          <p>This step protects you in the future. Without final approval it can be harder to refinance, sell, or show that the property meets current rules.</p>
          <p><strong>Your role</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Keep approval documents, as built drawings, and any maintenance instructions with your property records.</li>
            <li>Follow simple maintenance guidance for pumping, inspections, and system care for the years ahead.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>How Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help supports you</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>We confirm when final approval is issued and let you know which documents should be stored safely.</li>
            <li>We point out which records matter most for future sale, refinance, or family planning.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>By the end of Step 5 the project is complete. You have a modern system, clear paperwork, and a path forward for long term care.</p>

      <h3>Timeline what to expect</h3>
      <p>Timelines vary by property, by season, and by how busy engineers, installers, and reviewers are, but most projects follow a similar pattern.</p>
      <p>On a relatively straightforward property a typical sequence looks like this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 1 and Step 2, assessment and design, often take several weeks when everyone stays on task.</li>
        <li>Step 3, permitting, can range from a few weeks to a few months depending on review workload and how often clarifications are needed.</li>
        <li>Step 4, installation, is usually measured in days of active work once equipment arrives, though weather and delivery schedules can stretch that window.</li>
        <li>Step 5, final approval, usually follows soon after installation, but can lag if no one is watching the paperwork.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Without a coordinator, time is often lost in the gaps between steps. A design is finished but not submitted, a review comment sits unanswered, or an installer is ready but the permit is still pending. These gaps are where months disappear.</p>
      <p>With Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help, the focus is on shrinking those gaps. We can not control every delay, but we can make sure that your file is not the one that drifts to the back of a desk simply because no one is asking where it stands.</p>

      <h3>What to expect on your property</h3>
      <p>One of the most common concerns is what will happen to the yard during installation. It is easier to move forward when you have a clear picture of what the work looks like and how long the disruption will last.</p>
      <p>During installation you can expect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Equipment access through the driveway or another planned route into the work area.</li>
        <li>Excavation of the tank location and disposal area, which can temporarily create open pits or trenches.</li>
        <li>Stockpiles of soil and gravel that will be used for backfilling and contouring.</li>
        <li>Short term noise from engines, compactors, and hand tools.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After installation the goal is to return the property to usable condition as agreed in the scope. That may mean gravel in drive areas, soil and grass seed in lawn areas, or preparation for landscaping that you plan to handle yourself.</p>
      <p>Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help helps you prepare by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Making sure you know in advance which areas will be disturbed and which will stay untouched.</li>
        <li>Helping you talk through access, parking, and staging with the installer so you are not surprised when equipment arrives.</li>
        <li>Clarifying what restoration is included at the end of the job and what would be considered extra work.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This preparation means fewer last second decisions and less stress while work is underway.</p>

      <h3>Costs in plain language</h3>
      <p>Costs vary by property and system type. Many projects land in the tens of thousands of dollars, with simpler sites lower and complex sites higher. Rocky ground, steep slopes, shallow groundwater, narrow access, and long electrical runs can all add cost. Additional treatment units can also increase both installation and long term maintenance costs.</p>
      <p>Most homeowners do not pay one large lump sum in cash. Instead, people usually combine savings with financing that fits their situation. Some owners use home equity, some use personal loans, and some use other forms of credit. The right choice depends on income, credit, and how the property fits into long term plans.</p>
      <p>In broad terms, total project costs often include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Engineering and design fees for assessment, plans, and permit submittals.</li>
        <li>Permit and review fees charged by agencies.</li>
        <li>Installation costs, which include labor, equipment, excavation, backfill, and final grading.</li>
        <li>Materials such as tanks, chambers or trenches, pumps, control panels, and electrical work.</li>
        <li>Site restoration such as gravel, topsoil, grass seed, or limited concrete replacement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The largest source of frustration is usually not the base cost itself, but the surprises that show up when communication is unclear. A design that has to be revised during review, an installer who discovers something that could have been seen earlier, or a permit that sits untouched for months can all create extra costs and change orders.</p>
      <p>Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help focuses on clear steps and coordination so you waste less time and avoid repeated work. When you open a file with us we help you understand the likely range for your situation, how the money usually flows across the 5 steps, and where careful planning can prevent the avoidable extras that often stress homeowners.</p>

      <h3>Example projects</h3>
      <p>Every property is different, but a few simple examples can make the process easier to picture.</p>
      <p><strong>Example 1 In town lot with limited yard</strong></p>
      <p>A homeowner on a smaller in town lot has a driveway, a small lawn, and very little spare space. The cesspool sits under an area that is now used for parking. The owner is concerned that there is no room for a new system and that the yard will be unusable for a long time.</p>
      <p>Through Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help, the owner completes a short intake. We connect them with an engineer who works regularly in their district and is familiar with small lots. The design finds a layout that preserves critical parking and uses a compact disposal area that still meets the rules. We then help the owner connect with an installer who works cleanly in tight spaces and restore the yard quickly.</p>
      <p><strong>Example 2 Rural property with slope and drainage</strong></p>
      <p>A rural property sits on a slope above a gulch with seasonal flow. The owner worries that rules about setbacks and groundwater will make a new system impossible or extremely expensive.</p>
      <p>After intake, we connect the owner with an engineer who has handled similar properties. Extra care is taken with elevations and drain pathways. The design places the system where it has stable support and safe separation from water features. We then coordinate with an installer who is comfortable working on slopes and make sure the engineer and installer are aligned before work begins.</p>
      <p>In both examples the owner does not have to assemble the team alone. Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help remains the point of contact and keeps the file moving from step to step.</p>

      <h3>Quick questions</h3>
      <p>Here are short answers to some of the questions homeowners ask most often.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Do I need to upgrade right now</strong><br>
        The law sets a final deadline, but many owners choose to act earlier based on property plans. When you open a file with us we talk through your timing, upcoming projects, and how to avoid being forced into a rushed decision near the end.</li>
        <li><strong>What if I plan to sell before 2050</strong><br>
        Buyers and lenders are already paying attention to cesspools. Having a clear plan or completed upgrade can make sale and financing smoother. We help you understand how your situation is likely to appear to a buyer or lender.</li>
        <li><strong>What if my property is unusual</strong><br>
        Many properties do not fit the simple textbook examples. That is normal. We are used to working with steep slopes, lava, high rainfall, and shorelines. The important step is to start the process so a qualified engineer can review your specific site.</li>
        <li><strong>How much of this can I do myself</strong><br>
        You are always in control of decisions, but engineering, permitting, and installation must be handled by qualified professionals. Our role is to connect you with those professionals and keep the moving parts tied together so you are not left to manage them alone.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you want deeper answers to detailed questions, you can also read our FAQ page or open a file so we can look at your situation directly.</p>

    <section class="guide-section">
      <h3>Why it pays to start early</h3>
      <p>Delays usually come from missing information, busy engineers or installers, permit questions, and gaps between steps when no one owns the next move. Those problems grow as more owners move toward the same deadline and compete for the same limited pool of professionals.</p>
      <p>Starting earlier gives you more installer choice, smoother reviews, and less pressure from crowded schedules. It also gives you room to line up financing, coordinate with other planned work on the property, and choose a time of year that fits your life instead of reacting when options are limited.</p>
      <p>Act 125 sets the deadline at 2050, but that does not mean it is wise to wait until the last years. As the deadline approaches, demand for engineers and installers will rise. Projects that start early are more likely to move at a calm, predictable pace. Projects that start late are more likely to face longer waits and rushed decisions.</p>
      <p>Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help is set up to help you begin while there is still breathing room. Once your file is open, the project has a defined path instead of being a vague problem for some future year.</p>

      <h3>Why homeowners choose Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help</h3>
      <p><strong>Without a coordinator</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You search for an engineer and hope for callbacks.</li>
        <li>You guess which installer to use and compare quotes without clear context.</li>
        <li>You track permits, review comments, and status on your own.</li>
        <li>You may not know whether a delay is normal or a sign that the file has stalled.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>With Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You submit one intake that captures the key information about your property and goals.</li>
        <li>We connect you with licensed professionals who are a good fit for your area and project type.</li>
        <li>We coordinate communication so the engineer, installer, and reviewers each get what they need without constantly pulling you back into the middle.</li>
        <li>We keep you updated in plain language and help you see the project as a series of clear steps instead of a long, confusing tangle.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The same rules and technical standards apply whether or not you use a coordinator. The difference is how much of the load you carry yourself. Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help is designed so that you can focus on decisions instead of paperwork and scheduling.</p>
