  <p>Answers to common questions about cesspool conversion on Hawaiʻi Island and how coordination works.</p>
 </div>
</header>

<main class="faq-page">
  <p class="faq-intro">
    This page gathers key questions from state guidance and from homeowners so you can understand the law, the process and how Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help supports projects across the island.
  </p>

  <h2 class="faq-section-title">Law and deadlines</h2>
  <div class="faq-list">
    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Which Hawaiʻi law requires cesspools to be upgraded by 2050 and what does it mean for homeowners</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          Act 125 passed in 2017 requires every cesspool in the state of Hawaiʻi to be upgraded, converted or connected to an approved wastewater system by the year 2050. For homeowners this means that a cesspool cannot remain in use forever and will need to be replaced by a permitted septic system, aerobic treatment unit or sewer connection within that timeframe, with some areas expected to convert earlier based on priority maps.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>When am I required to upgrade my cesspool</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      All cesspools must be converted by 2050, but many owners will have to upgrade earlier when a property is sold, when a house is substantially renovated, when the cesspool fails or when it lies in a high priority area near drinking water or the ocean. Department of Health and county offices, along with the Hawaiʻi cesspool prioritization maps, provide guidance about local timelines and triggers that can move your deadline forward.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>What happens if I do not convert my cesspool by the required deadline</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      Act 125 makes cesspool conversion a legal requirement. Owners who do not upgrade by the required time risk enforcement actions, restrictions on property use, complications when trying to sell and potential liability if the cesspool harms water resources. Specific penalties and enforcement steps are set by law and Department of Health rules and may change as new programs and regulations are adopted.
    </p>

  <h2 class="faq-section-title">Process and permits</h2>
  <div class="faq-list">
    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>How do I convert my cesspool to a septic system on Hawaiʻi Island</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          Department of Health guidance explains that the first step is to hire a Hawaiʻi licensed civil engineer to design a new individual wastewater system such as a septic system or aerobic treatment unit. The engineer prepares a design that meets state rules and submits it with permit forms to the Department of Health or County as required. After permit approval a licensed contractor installs the new system, closes the cesspool and schedules any required inspections before final approval to use the new system.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>


<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>What are the main steps in a cesspool conversion project in Hawaiʻi</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      Typical steps are site check and records review with an engineer, design of a compliant individual wastewater system, permit application and review, construction by a licensed contractor, inspection and final approval and then closure of the old cesspool. On Hawaiʻi Island homeowners are responsible for hiring the engineer and contractor and for paying project costs, although grants or tax relief may offset part of the cost when available.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>What permits are needed to convert a cesspool on Hawaiʻi Island</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      At minimum an individual wastewater system approval from the Department of Health Wastewater Branch is required. County building or plumbing permits may also be needed for excavation, plumbing and electrical work. The engineer usually prepares the Department of Health forms and design package while the contractor may handle county building permit applications with support from the engineer.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Who inspects and approves my new septic system in Hawaiʻi</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      Wastewater system designs and as built information are reviewed and approved by the Hawaiʻi Department of Health Wastewater Branch and in some counties by county building and plumbing officials. The engineer and contractor coordinate inspections. When construction is complete and the system passes inspection the Department of Health issues final approval to use the new system and the cesspool can be properly closed.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Can I connect to a public sewer instead of installing a new septic system</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      In locations with an accessible public sewer it may be possible to abandon the cesspool and connect to the sewer system instead of building a new septic system. This still requires design review and permits, and costs depend on distance to the sewer main and on any road and utility work. In rural areas without nearby sewer, a septic system or aerobic treatment unit with a disposal field is usually required.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Can I phase a cesspool conversion over time</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      Design and permit approval must cover the full system, but some owners plan cash flow by separating costs into stages. For example they may pay for design and permits first, then schedule installation during a later dry season or after funding is confirmed. Once construction starts the system needs to be completed and inspected promptly to protect health and safety. Any phasing ideas should be discussed with the engineer and contractor before permits are submitted.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

  </div>

  <h2 class="faq-section-title">Engineers, contractors and system design</h2>
  <div class="faq-list">
    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Do I need a civil engineer to convert my cesspool</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          Yes. Department of Health guidance states that the first step in upgrading or replacing a cesspool is to hire a Hawaiʻi licensed civil engineer. The engineer designs an individual wastewater system that meets state rules, prepares the permit package and often helps coordinate with the contractor and regulators during the project.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>


<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>What is an individual wastewater system in Hawaiʻi</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      An individual wastewater system in Hawaiʻi is a private onsite system that treats and disposes of wastewater from a single home or a small group of buildings. For cesspool conversions the usual options are a septic system with a tank and leach field or an aerobic treatment unit with a disposal field. The design must follow Department of Health wastewater rules and be approved before construction.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>What types of systems can replace a cesspool in Hawaiʻi</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      Department of Health recognizes several individual wastewater system types. For most homes the practical options are a conventional septic system with a tank and leach field or an aerobic treatment unit that treats wastewater before it reaches the disposal area. In some locations connection to a public sewer is possible. The engineer chooses the appropriate system based on soil tests, groundwater depth, lot size, setbacks and state rules.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>What information should I gather before talking to an engineer about cesspool conversion</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      Useful information includes the tax map key for the property, any existing permits or as built drawings, past septic or cesspool approvals, number of bedrooms and plumbing fixtures, water source, photos or sketches of the current cesspool location and any site constraints such as steep slopes, rock outcrops or limited yard space. The more complete the information, the easier it is for an engineer to propose realistic options and rough cost ranges.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Who is responsible for handling permit forms, plans and inspections</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      The licensed civil engineer typically prepares the wastewater design and Department of Health forms, and may support the contractor on county building or plumbing permit applications. The contractor manages construction and coordinates with the engineer and inspectors. The homeowner hires these professionals and pays for their work, while the agencies review plans and grant approvals.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>


  </div>

  <h2 class="faq-section-title">Costs, money and financial help</h2>
  <div class="faq-list">
    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>How much does it cost to convert a cesspool to a septic system on Hawaiʻi Island</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          Costs vary with access, soil conditions, lot size, slope, rock depth, groundwater depth and whether a simple septic system or a more advanced system is needed. Hawaiʻi guides and homeowner reports often describe project totals starting in the low tens of thousands of dollars and going higher for complex sites. Only a site visit and design by a licensed engineer, along with quotes from local installers, can provide a realistic estimate for a specific property.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>


<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Who pays for cesspool conversion in Hawaiʻi</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      Private landowners are responsible for closing their cesspools and paying for connection to an approved wastewater system unless a grant program, tax credit or special funding source reduces their share. Some owners may qualify for state grants, tax benefits or federal rural programs, but even with assistance homeowners often pay a large part of the cost themselves.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Are there grants or tax credits for cesspool conversion in Hawaiʻi</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      Hawaiʻi has offered several financial support tools including a cesspool pilot grant program that reimbursed part of the cost for a limited number of homeowners and state income tax credits that reduce the cost of upgrades to qualifying cesspools. Lawmakers have considered bills to extend and expand these programs and amounts and eligibility rules can change. Homeowners should check the current Department of Health financial support information and review any active tax credit or grant programs before starting work.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>How can I plan for the cost of a cesspool conversion and avoid surprises</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      A realistic plan starts with an engineer reviewing records and visiting the site, then providing a design that installers can price. Owners can request multiple quotes, ask for separate line items for design, permits and construction and ask about rock excavation or groundwater issues that could add cost. Some owners stage design and construction over time or explore loans and assistance programs so that the project fits their budget.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>


  </div>

  <h2 class="faq-section-title">Timeline and scheduling</h2>
  <div class="faq-list">
    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>How long does a cesspool conversion project usually take</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          From first contact to final approval many projects take several months. Time is spent gathering records and site information, having an engineer prepare and submit a design, waiting for permit review, scheduling excavation and installation and completing inspections. During periods of heavy demand permit review and contractor schedules can add more time, which is why agencies encourage owners to start well before any deadline.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>


<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>How do permit backlogs and contractor schedules affect timing on Hawaiʻi Island</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      On Hawaiʻi Island review times and contractor availability can stretch out during busy periods, during storms or when new laws increase demand. Starting early, having complete information ready for your engineer and being flexible about construction windows helps reduce delays and gives more options for scheduling work around weather and other projects.
    </p>

  <h2 class="faq-section-title">Environment and property value</h2>
  <div class="faq-list">
    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>How do cesspools affect drinking water and coral reefs</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          Cesspools simply collect and dispose of raw wastewater without treatment. Across the state they can release millions of gallons of sewage into the ground each day. This can send pathogens and nutrients into groundwater that supplies most of Hawaiʻi drinking water and into streams and the ocean where it can damage coral reefs and harm people who swim and fish. This public health and environmental impact is the main reason the state is phasing cesspools out.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>


<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Does converting a cesspool increase property value</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      Many buyers and lenders view a modern permitted wastewater system as a positive feature because it reduces future legal risk and environmental impact. Some agencies already require disclosure when a property has a cesspool, especially if it appears in the state priority maps. Upgrading now can remove a future obstacle for sale and may make a property more attractive in a market where more buyers are aware of the 2050 requirement.
    </p>

  <h2 class="faq-section-title">Tools, maps and priority areas</h2>
  <div class="faq-list">
    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What is the Hawaiʻi cesspool hazard and prioritization tool</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          The Hawaiʻi Cesspool Prioritization Tool is an online map created by the University of Hawaiʻi Sea Grant program and the state that ranks each cesspool by its risk to groundwater, drinking water and nearshore waters. The maps show priority levels and recommended timelines so owners and policymakers can see which areas should convert first in order to protect water quality and public health.
        </p>
      </div>
    </details>


<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>How can I find out whether my cesspool is in a high priority area</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      You can use the Hawaiʻi Cesspool Prioritization Tool, county maps and Department of Health guidance to see whether your property falls in a higher priority zone, such as areas near drinking water wells, streams or the shoreline. Engineers who work in your district are also familiar with local priority designations and expected conversion timelines.

  <summary>Is Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help an engineer or a contractor</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help is not an engineering firm and does not install systems. It is a coordination service. Licensed civil engineers provide designs that meet state rules and independent local contractors install the systems. The coordination service brings the right parties together and keeps the process organized while licensed professionals handle design and construction.

  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      The service operates as part of a coordinated network funded by licensed engineers and installers who take on projects. That means homeowners can receive project coordination without extra charges or markups on top of normal engineering and construction fees. Homeowners only pay the professionals they choose to hire for design and installation.

  <summary>What do you do with my personal and property information</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      Information provided to Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help is used to create a project file, understand site constraints and share a clear summary with the single licensed engineer and any installer that the homeowner authorizes. The service does not sell data. Sharing is limited to the professionals needed to move the project forward.

  <summary>Can Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help assist if my cesspool fails or is damaged by a storm</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      If a cesspool fails, floods or is damaged by a storm or other event, the property owner still must meet Department of Health requirements for safe wastewater handling. Hawaiʻi Cesspool Help can help the owner connect quickly with a licensed engineer and local contractors who can evaluate the site and propose compliant replacement options so that health and environmental risks are reduced as soon as possible.

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>What should I do first if I have a cesspool on Hawaiʻi Island and want to plan a conversion</summary>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>
          First confirm that a cesspool exists on the property and collect basic information such as the tax map key, number of bedrooms, water source and any old permits or drawings. Reviewing the priority maps and reading Department of Health guidance helps set expectations. From there, contacting a coordination service or an engineer who works in your district is a practical way to understand options and timing.

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>How can I tell whether now is the right time to move forward with design and permits</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>
      Owners often move forward when they plan to sell, renovate, refinance or when they learn that their area is considered high priority. If a cesspool is aging, failing or located close to drinking water or the shoreline, acting sooner can reduce risk and avoid rushed work later as deadlines get closer. Talking with an engineer or coordination service about your specific property is the best way to decide on timing.
